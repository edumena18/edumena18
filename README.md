## About me

I have 7+ years of professional experience, managing complex IT systems.  In my career I found that I enjoyed performing acceptance testing prior to major feature rollouts.  I want to build on that experience to launch my next career in software testing.  I have worked for several years outside of the tech industry while developing my English skills.  I’m confident I have the technical and English skills to return to a technology job.
